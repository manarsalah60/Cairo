              <h2>About the University</h2>
              <p>
                Cairo University is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the Arab world,
                established in 1908 under the name Egyptian University. It was later renamed King Fuad I University,
                before adopting its current name in 1952. Located in Giza, just across the Nile from central Cairo, 
                the university has long stood as a beacon of academic excellence and scientific research in the Middle East.
                With over 250,000 students enrolled across undergraduate and postgraduate programs,
                the university offers a wide range of disciplines through more than 25 faculties and institutes.
                Cairo University is consistently recognized in international rankings,
                placing among the top 500 universities worldwide in the QS World University Rankings 2024.
                It continues to advance in subject-specific and research-related rankings,
                reflecting its strong commitment to innovation, knowledge, and quality education.

              <h2>About Cairo University Dome</h2>
              <p>
                The Dome of Cairo University, also known as the Grand Celebration Hall, 
                is one of the most prominent architectural landmarks in Egypt. Established
                in 1935, the hall is distinguished by its massive dome, which has the shape of
                a half-sphere, standing 52 meters tall, making it a notable symbol of the
                university. The idea for building the dome originated from King Fouad I, who
                laid the foundation stone for the university's administration building on February
                7, 1928. Designed by French engineers in a style similar to Egypt's Parliament building,
                the interior hall was modeled after the design of the old Egyptian opera house.The dome 
                is an integral part of Cairo University's rich history and has witnessed many significant cultural
                and artistic events, making it an important landmark in Egypt's educational and cultural history.
